* ### ![ ](helpImgs/hangman_icon_small.png) The game
Hangman is a classic word game in which you must guess the secret word one letter at a time.
Each incorrect guess adds another body part to the hangman. When its body is complete you fail that round.

* ### Rules
The player starts with 5 lives. After each failed round you lose a life and the game round. When you have no more lives left the game ends. The end score may then be recorded in the player’s personal highscore or the general Top 5 Leaderboard. Starting another game will then reset all the player resources, lives, and score. The player is able to choose the language and avatar for each game only before the game begins.

* ### Resources
The player can gain or exchange various resources.
